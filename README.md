*Scope* is still under development. It will be a compiled, object-oriented programming langauge.

## Building

These dependencies are required to build:
- `java`
- `maven`

After these are installed run:

```bash
# Clone...
$ git clone https://github.com/EliteAsian123/Scope.git
# Build... 
$ mvn package
# Run!
$ ./run.sh <FILE>
```

## Running / Linux

`fasm` is required to run a Scope program.

```bash
$ ./scope <file>
```

`<file>` is relative to `env/`. This script temporarily creates a file called `_temp`.

## Why Java? â˜•
