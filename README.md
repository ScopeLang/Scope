*Scope* is still under development. It will be a compiled, object-oriented programming langauge.

## Building

These dependencies are required to build:
- `java`
- `maven`

After these are installed, run:

```bash
# Clone...
$ git clone https://github.com/EliteAsian123/Scope.git
# Build...
$ mvn package
# That is it! Make sure to check `Running / (YOUR OS)`
```

## Running / Linux

`fasm` is required to run a Scope program.
`fasm` can be installed with `sudo apt install fasm`.

```bash
$ ./scope <file>
```
